        <p>Bryant eyes the basket during the NBA Slam Dunk Contest at All-Star Weekend on Feb. 8, 1997. On that day, at age 18, Bryant became the youngest player ever to win the contest.</p>

        <p>Bryant shoots a free throw for his 81st point against the Toronto Raptors on Jan. 22, 2006. His 81-point scoring total that night was the second highest in NBA history.</p>

        <img src="images/09.jpeg" height="500" alt="09">
        <p>Bryant celebrates the Lakers winning the 2008-2009 NBA championship, on June 14, 2009, in Orlando, Florida. Bryant won Finals MVP honors, as the Lakers easily defeated the Magic in a five-game series.</p>

        <p>Moments after tearing his Achilles on April 12, 2013, Bryant somehow manages to sink two free throws before leaving the game. Less than 24 hours later, Bryant had season-ending surgery.</p>

        <img src="images/14.jpeg" height="500" alt="14">
        <p>On Dec. 8, 2013, Bryant steps onto the court for his first game since tearing his Achilles the previous spring. Unsurprisingly, he received a huge ovation from the Staples Center crowd all throughout that night’s contest against the Toronto Raptors.</p>

        <p>Bryant waves to the Philadelphia crowd, acknowledging their loud ovation, prior to the Lakers’ contest against the 76ers on Dec 1, 2015. Philadelphia held a pre-game ceremony for Bryant, honoring his 20-year NBA career.</p>
